# BioShield-Behavioral-Biometric-Auth
A next-generation passive authentication system leveraging behavioral biometrics such as mouse dynamics, gaze tracking, and micro-interactions to establish an invisible, continuous identity verification layer.
 
Features
Continuous Authentication — Monitors user activity in real-time.
Behavioral Biometrics — Tracks cursor trajectories, gaze coordinates, and interaction cadence.
Machine Learning Core (SVM) — Trains on individual behavioral signatures for high-accuracy classification.
Data Logging & Storage — Captures, normalizes, and securely stores user behavioral profiles.
Modular Design — Easily integrates into existing identity management systems.
